# Diamonds Dataset
The dataset contains information on prices of diamonds, as well as various attributes of diamonds, some of which are known to influence their price (in 2008 US Dollars): the 4 Cs (`carat`, `cut`, `color`, and `clarity`), as well as some physical measurements (`depth`, `table`, `price`, `x`, `y`, and `z`). 

Physical measurements are explained by the following picture.

The carat is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls. Cut grade is is an objective measure of a diamondâ€™s light performance, or, what we generally think of as sparkle.
